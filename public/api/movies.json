    "desc": "Social media fame is the ultimate curse in writer-director Kurtis David Harder’s latest. Released as a Shudder Original, Influencer set itself apart from traditional horror fare by flipping a well-worn trope on its head. From Single White Female to Ingrid Goes West, there’s no shortage of movies about lonely girls making trouble, but this film’s clever twists and shocking turns (particularly after the title sequence) left IMDb fans calling it the most underrated horror movie of the year.",

    "desc": "It took seven years for Irish novelist Bram Stoker to write his seminal classic \"Dracula.\" But would you believe it took Hollywood three times that long to bring The Last Voyage of the Demeter to the screen? Good things seem to come to those who wait, and fans of period horror stories were rewarded when the film finally sailed into theaters this summer. Crafted from a single chapter of the landmark novel, the movie earned high marks from viewers who longed to see an adaptation indulge in the monstrous side of the Transylvanian terror.",
